Programming guidelines:
  
  
  For GUI's:
    Name variables using an identifier of the object followed by the name of the variable. For example,
    if you want to create a button and you want to name it "myButton", name it "btnMyButton" instead. This will help to have 
    identified the components that can have the same name but different form. I suggest some abreviations of different components:
      - Button: btn
      - TextField: tf
      - CheckBox: cb
      - MenuItem: mi
      - Label: lb
      
     If you need other components, feel free to decide which identifier use and please modify this file telling us what identifier
     name you used.
